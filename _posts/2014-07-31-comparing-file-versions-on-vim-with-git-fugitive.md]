You have foo.rb open in your feature branch and you want to check how this file was on the mater branch?

Do this:

{% highlight vim %}
:Gedit master:foo.rb
{% endhighlight %}

Syntax:

{% highlight vim %}
:Gedit [branchname or commit hash]:filename
{% endhighlight %}

Tip:

Use the “%” symbol for using the path of the current file:

{% highlight vim %}
:Gedit master:%
{% endhighlight %}

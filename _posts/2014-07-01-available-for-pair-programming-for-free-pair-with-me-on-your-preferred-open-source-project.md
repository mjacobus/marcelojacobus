Hi there.

I’ve been willing to practice pair program. Since that is not something I can achieve in my current job, my goal is to do that remotely with anyone who is willing to work on any open source project.

If you are interested, please get in touch. I am a Ruby/PHP/Javascript programmer and I am all into TDD/BDD, so if you have tested code that would be awesome. Comfortable with VIM would be a plus, since working on the terminal seems easier/faster.

If you have a open project you are working on, please send me the project url so I can have an idea about what that is and how that works (or is supposed to). If you don’t, perhaps we could contribute to some awesome open source project out there, such as Rails, Devise, Zend Framework or what have you, perhaps fixing some bugs.

I intend to be available every Monday from 23:00 to 00:00 (GMT-03:00).

See ya.

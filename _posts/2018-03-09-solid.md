**Note**: Also, the bellow exemples are not complete. They are only pseudo code and there could be improvements to that.

These are the solid principles

- **Single responsibility principle** - a class should have only a single responsibility - One reason to change
- **Open/closed principle** - software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Liskov substitution principle** - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- **Interface segregation principle** - many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- **Dependency inversion principle** - one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

## Violations

- Single responsibility
  - Connects to the DB
  - validates uniqueness of mail
  - validates email format
  - validates password format/strength
  - inserts record in the data base
  - sends email
- Open Closed
  - What if we do not want to use Email? What if we want to use SMS? Push notification?
- Liskov substitution principle
 - not yet
- Interface segregation principle
 - not yet
- Dependency inversion principle


## After SOLID.

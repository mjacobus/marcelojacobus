The first edition of [DDD Europe](http://dddeurope.com/2016) took place in
Belgium, during January 26th to the 29th. Thanks to [Goodgame Studios](http://goodgamestudios.com),
the five of us
[Gregor](https://twitter.com/gregormey),
[Marco](https://twitter.com/mamuz_de),
[Marius](https://twitter.com/elsuperbeano),
[Oliver](https://twitter.com/whatthemack) and myself
were able to attend the conference.


It was very interesting and we could bring some valuable thoughts to share with
our workmates.


## TLDR; Some nice insights to remember:

- Mimicking the real world is unrealistic.
- software development is a learning process
- working code is a side effect
- Expose the real problem
- Understanding the problem must be cheap
- A proper implementation is Value vs Cost
- The goal is not to write cool software. The goal is to solve the right problem


## Day one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the [agenda](http://dddeurope.com/2016/#28th);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Keynote
*by Eric Evans*

- Mimicking the real world is unrealistic.
- Maps were used for navigation

Eric showed an example of maps, which model a real thing: the world. While some
maps distort the reality a bit (I.E. country sizes) they are easier to use when
it comes to discerning the distance between two points in the map than the
'accurate' models.

While the technology has progressed a lot since then, the book and techniques
are still relevant today.  Even more so! The tools are so much better than
2003. This allows developers to spend relatively less time on fighting with
heavyweight J2EE or ORM frameworks, and relatively more time on domain
modeling.

### The Precision Blade
by Alberto Brandolini

[slides](http://de.slideshare.net/ziobrando/the-precision-blade)

- "you can’t achieve simplicity without diving into chaos, just like putting all your clothes on the floor to sort them out."
- software development is a learning process
- working code is a side effect
- Event storming
  - Invite the right people
    - people with questions
    - people with answers
    - a facilitator

 - provide an unlimited modeling surface
 - model with **domain events**

Domain Event is:

- Orange sticky note
- verb at past tense
- relevant for domain experts

Goals:

##### Solving the right problem?

In the core domain details make a difference

- Creative
- Always looking for alternatives
- Continuously refining solutions
- Perfectionist

#### Can we succeed?

- Make the risk observable


- Understanding the problem must be cheap
- A proper implementation is Value vs Cost
- The goal is not to write cool software. The goal is to solve the right problem

### Software Design and the Physics of Software

### Hands-on: Integrating DDD, BDD and UXD
by Paul Rayner

In my opinion this was the most interesting one. We used several techniques of
investigating the problem.

The proto-persona [approach](https://twitter.com/thepaulrayner/status/693019436345901057)
helped us to put ourselves into "Bob"'s shoes. It helped us to sympathize and to
care about his problems.

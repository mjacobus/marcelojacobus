Keep Ctrl+w from closing Firefox tab

When working with Vim I tend to hit Ctrl+w so I can change splits. I also tend to do that while im not focused on the terminal, and I end up closing the current Firefox tab.

The solution is to map the tab closing on Firefox to another combination, like Ctrl+f4.

That can be accomplished by installing [this plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/customizable-shortcuts/). The plugin page shows how you can do this remapping. Go to “Edit > Preferences > Shortcuts” in order to disable shortcut.

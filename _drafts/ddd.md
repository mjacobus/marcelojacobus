— Key Note

FOCUS on opportunities

Twister !?


A solution to a problem model

Model a solution just for a problem/ opportunity not for the complete system

The system is evolutionary.

The art is to build a table not to master a saw.

The tools must be mastered to be able to focus on the art.

Working Code is a side effect, it about learning...

Modeling must be done to the end. **No Time box!**

Skip the boring parts

Challenge the Model.. Ask questions.


Take care that there is enough space

Invite the right people

Offer help. Empathy

build up a collaboration

Make proposals even when they are bad


Use prototypes create haptical examples

Code can help to ask better questions

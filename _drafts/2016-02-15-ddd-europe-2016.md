The first edition of [DDD Europe](http://dddeurope.com/2016) took place in
Belgium, during January 26th to the 29th. Thanks to [Goodgame Studios](http://goodgamestudios.com), 
the five of us (OUR NAMES) were able to attend the last 2 days (the first 2
were "pre-conference", when the paid workshops happened).

It was very interesting and we could bring some valuable thoughts to share with
our workmates.
